# my_blog

the blog has uploaded to the following url and can be seen live here:
 https://wd-my-blog.glitch.me/
 
the database (db.json) does not load because it uses a local host link 
so in order for the full blog to run properly it requires you to download the project and follow the following steps.

STEPS:

1. download the repo's contents and unzip it on the desktop

2. install npm and node. ( if it is already intsalled  then thats good!)

3. inthe console type "npm install" to install all the required files.

4. run the node server  on localhost:3000 by typing "nodemon start".

5. run the data base on localhost:8080 by typing "json-server --watch db.json --port 8080"

if the application runs properly it means you did a good job! But if it does not work then a mistakes has bin made during this process
and i urge you to check on that and see what might have gone wrong.

thanks for reading and enjoy!! :)
