# blog_2.0

the blog has uploaded to the following url and can be seen live here:

the database (db.json) does not load because it uses a local host link so in order for the full blog to run properly it requires you to download the project and follow the following steps.

STEPS:

download the repo's contents and unzip it on the desktop

install npm and node. ( if it is already intsalled then thats good!)

inthe console type "npm install" to install all the required files.

run the node server on localhost:3000 by typing "nodemon start".

run the data base on localhost:8080 by typing "json-server --watch db.json --port 8080"

if the application runs properly it means you did a good job! But if it does not work then a mistakes has bin made during this process and i urge you to check on that and see what might have gone wrong.

thanks for reading and enjoy!! :)
