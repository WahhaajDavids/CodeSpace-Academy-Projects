          Mamoru Hosoda’s anime fantasy “The Boy and the Beast” is a curious hybrid with a foot in two realms. It begins vividly, in a gritty and monochromatic rendering of the Shibuya district in Tokyo, where a 9-year-old runaway, Ren, scrapes by.

          Parents need to know that The Boy and the Beast is a subtitled animated Japanese fantasy about an orphaned human boy who ends up being taken under the tutelage of a "beast" in a fantasy kingdom. This coming-of-age story has fish-out-of-water, adoption, and hero's-journey themes, and it features several battles, sword fights, and near deaths -- as well as an actual death (though it leads to reincarnation). The language is sometimes strong -- including "s--t," "damn," "pissed off," etc. -- but the messages about the nature of strength and the importance of perseverance, determination, and teamwork are clear. It's ideal for older tweens and young teens who are ready for more mature animated adventures.
