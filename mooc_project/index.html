          <h2>The Pamadora Technique</h2>
          <img src="images/The-Pomodoro-Technique.jpg" alt="Responsive image">
          <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
          <br>
          The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts</p>

          <h2>Focused and Defused Thinking</h2>
          <img src="images/thinking.jpg" alt="">
          <h3>Focused Thought</h3>
          <p>When we are solving a problem, there are two ways we can consider it: using focused thinking or using diffuse thinking. Focused thinking is pretty straightforward—it’s focused. We use focused thinking when we are really concentrating on the matter at hand. Focused thinking is a highly attentive state of mind where the brain uses its best concentration abilities in the prefrontal cortex to ignore all extraneous information.
          <br>
          When we are in our focused mode of thinking, it’s like we have a one-track mind for the matter at hand. Distractions don’t exist. Whether we are practicing a specific skill like free-throws or slogging through a specific math problem, focused thinking allows us to zoom directly in on the most pertinent information.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Diffuse Thought</h3>
          <p>Diffuse thinking, on the other hand, looks at the big picture. Unlike focused thinking, diffuse thinking is all about distractions. Diffuse thinking happens when you let your mind wander freely, making connections at random. The diffuse mode of thinking does not happen any one area of the brain, but rather all over. In fact, that is the beauty of diffuse thinking: your brain has the opportunity to connect the dots and link neural processes.
          <br>
          Usually, diffuse thinking happens as you do other things. That’s why taking a shower or going for a run to take a break from studying can actually lead to an important breakthrough. While your conscious mind is relaxed, your brain is able to form a creative solution to a problem or finally link ideas that had been eluding you.</p>

          <h2>Procrastination</h2>
          <iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4P785j15Tzk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <p>Procrastination is often confused with laziness, but they are very different.
            <br>
            Procrastination is an active process – you choose to do something else instead of the task that you know you should be doing. In contrast, laziness   suggests apathy, inactivity and an unwillingness to act.
            <br>
            Procrastination usually involves ignoring an unpleasant, but likely more important task, in favor of one that is more enjoyable or easier.
            <br>
            But giving in to this impulse can have serious consequences. For example, even minor episodes of procrastination can make us feel guilty or ashamed. It can lead to reduced productivity and cause us to miss out on achieving our goals.
            <br>
            If we procrastinate over a long period of time, we can become demotivated and disillusioned with our work, which can lead to depression and even job loss, in extreme cases.</p>
